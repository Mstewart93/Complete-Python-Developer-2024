# Tricky Counter Excersise

my_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

counter = 0

for item in my_list:
    
    counter = counter + item

print(counter) #this indentation will print that you get the totall of all the numbers 


for i in my_list:
    
    counter2 = counter2 + item
    print(counter2) # this indentation will give you each item in your list printed 


#Range used for looping most commonly.
